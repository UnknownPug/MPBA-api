# This YAML configuration specifies a database change log for managing database migrations.
# It includes two SQL change log files:

# 1. db/changelog/db.changelog-tables-init.sql:
# This file is expected to contain the initial SQL scripts for creating the necessary tables in the database.

# 2. db/changelog/db.changelog-admin-inject.sql:
# This file is intended for injecting an initial admin user into the user_profile table if it does not already exist.
